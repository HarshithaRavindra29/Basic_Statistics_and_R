# Basic_Statistics_and_R
This is an Exploratory data analysis task submitted as an assignment for a 
statistics course at the University of Illinois - Urbana - Champaign

In Code "County_complete_EDA_2variables.R" I have used basic measures of central tendencies and basic visualizations to study CountyComplete data.

Code: "CountyComplete_group_mean_models.R" studies county complete data using group mean models
Code: "countyComplete_Linear_model.R" studies county complete data using Linear model (1 variable) compares it with group mean model result

To run this, download "CountyComplete" dataset from the OpenIntro dataset
